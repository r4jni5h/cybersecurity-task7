## 📦 Extensions Reviewed:

| Extension Name             | Status     | Notes                                                       |
|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Adblock Plus              | Kept       | Trusted, widely used ad blocker.                           |
| AdBlock                   | Kept       | Also trusted, similar to Adblock Plus.                     |
| ChatGPT Search            | **Removed**| Not actively used, modifies search engine – unnecessary.   |
| Free VPN by 1clickvpn     | **Removed**| Free VPNs may pose security risks, not from a known vendor.|
| iCloud Passwords          | Kept       | Trusted extension by Apple for keychain integration.       |
